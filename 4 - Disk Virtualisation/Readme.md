### Tasks

#### 3.1. Disk Virtualization (Consolidation & Partitioning)

- Number of available disks should be read from a file.
- ~~Create two arrays for storing Blocks of disks A and B.~~
- ~~Block size is 100 bytes. Disk A has 200 blocks and Disk B has 300 Blocks~~
- Provide an API to a programmer so that it appear as one disk D of 500
blocks
- APIs could be Write / Read (block_No, block_inf) where block_no is 1..500ï‚· 
- Test it with random read / write of blocks
- Now create Disk of arbitrary size using an API CreateDisk(ID, No of blocks)
- Now this ID is used to read and write blocks.
- APIs could be Read/Write (ID, Block_No, Block_info,)
- It should return success if Block no within defined limit, else error
- Should be able to Create multiple Disk of arbitrary size, till no more space is left
- DeleteDisk(ID) would delete the disk and space is released , which can
then be used in subsequent Create Disk.
- Test it using various creates/delete/read/write operations
- Arbitrary Create and Delete disk will create holes in the Disk array and you may have to use a different way to store blocks of array in case of fragmentation
- Document your Design and give a demo


#### 3.2 Disk Virtualization : Block Replication

- This is an extension of 3.1. Modify the code for 3.1 to do Block Replication for providing reliable storage
- Write each block in two locations, so that in case one copy is in error, block can be read from the 2nd copy.
- The read operation should read from the first copy. In case it is in error, read from the 2nd copy.
- Before returning the value to the user, create additional copy in some other location (donot rewrite the error block. Flag it as bad block and never use it again).
- To simulate random read error, before reading a block generate a random number in the range 1-100. If the value is less than 10, assume reading the first copy has given an error.
- Test the system by doing large no of read and writes and see what is going on in the background where blocks are stored. Document your design and Give a demo.

#### 3.3. Disk Virtualization : SnapShoting
- This is an extension of 3.1. Modify the code for 3.1 to take a Snap Shot of the current version of the virtual Disk and roll back if needed.
- This feature lets the user create a checkpoint and then continue using the disk.
- Any number of checkpoints may be created. The user may return to any checkpoint at any time.
- API could be
    + Checkpoint (ID, No) No is the Checkpoint ID returned for later use.
    + Rollback (ID, Checkpoint_No) : Rolls back the virtual disk ID
- Test by doing multiple checkpoints and rolling back to anyone. 
- Document your design and Give a Demo
